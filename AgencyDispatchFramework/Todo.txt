What is this going to be?
	- A callout pack
	- A callout CAD included with callout details
	- Custom dispatch script
		- Dynamic crime levels based on TimeOfDay and weather
	- An API of sorts for other callout packs including:
		- Includes a dynamic Callout interaction menu to be used with callout conversations
			- Conversation handler for callout peds, with dynamic string replacements and conditions	
		- A location generator within the player's agency jurisdiction
			- Queryable locations based on LocationFlags
		- A ped generator based on age group, sex and variant groups.


ToDO:
	- AISceneSimulation
	- Figure out how to handle callouts outside this mod (since we cannot have extranal classes extend the AgencyCallout class)
	- Create a location type (Intersection) that can be used to setup various crash scenes within an intersection
		- IntersectionFlag.(2WayStop, 4WayStop, Lighted, 4WayYield, 2Lane, 4Lane, 6Lane, WithTurnLeftLane, WithTurnRightLane)

Radio traffic with Dispatch and AI (handshake for accepting calls):

	- Radio message is queued to call for officers ("Attention unit A 1 18")
	- An event is fired on the primary officer unit to asnwer the dispatcher
	- Radio message is queued by the primary officer with a response ("Dispatch this is A 1 18")
	- Radio message is played by the dispatcher with the call details ("We have a... on... Please respond code..")
	- An event is fired on the primary officer, call assigned awaiting confirmation
