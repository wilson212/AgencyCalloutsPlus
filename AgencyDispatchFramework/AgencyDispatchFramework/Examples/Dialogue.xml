            In this initial dialog (if selected at random based on the "probability"), we have 3 callbacks we can hook into
            within the CalloutScenario using the following method: Dialogue.RegisterCallback(name, Action);
            
            For all intents and purposes, a callback is basically just an event created dynamically, and calls on the Action
            supplied when the callback is registered in the CalloutScenario. Callbacks are not required to be defined.
            
            The "onFirstShown" callback gets fired when the first <Subtitle> node is displayed in game, calling the action
            registered as "First_Shown" ( Dialogue.RegisterCallback("First_Shown", Action) ) 
            
            The "onLastShown" callback gets fired when the last <Subtitle> node is displayed in game, calling the action
            registered as "Last_Shown" ( Dialogue.RegisterCallback("Last_Shown", Action) ) 
            
            The "elapsed" callback gets fired when the last <Subtitle> node has finished displaying in game, calling the action
            registered as "Elapsed_Shown" ( Dialogue.RegisterCallback("Elapsed_Shown", Action) )  
            
            A good use of callbacks would be to initiate a gun fight with the player after a subtitle is displayed, or run away
            from the officer, or making the ped preform a scenario. Really the posibilities are endless here.
