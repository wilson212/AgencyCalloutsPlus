<!-- 
  Here is an example Dialogue file. I have provided detailed explainations on how to design your 
  own Dialogues, and what each node does.
  
  A Dialogue represents a conversation flow between a Ped and the Player during a Callout Scenario.
  
  The "id" attribute must be defined, and must be unique to each Callout Scenario,
  because other loaded dialogues can reference the Menus in this dialogue by the ID.

  <!-- The Menus node builds a RageNativeUI questioning menu in which to interact with a Ped -->

      <!-- 
        A Question node describes a question that can be asked, and is displayed as a RageNativeUI button 
        
        The "id" attribute defines a question ID, that the code uses to find an answer from a Circumstance.
        
        NOTE: The "id" attribute must be unique for THIS entire file, not just this "Menu"!

          A <Sequence> node defines one or more Subtitle elements. Each Subtitle element will be played in
          the order defined below. Each <Question> and <Response> node can contain multiple <Sequence> nodes.
          One <Sequence> node will be chosen at random when the <Quesion[id]> is chosen, based on the 
          "probability" attribute value.
          
          Each <Sequence> should contain a similar response, statement or question but worded differently from eachother.
          Example: 1 <Sequence> could be a "Hello, how are you?", while the second <Sequence> could be "Hi, how have you been?".  
                   Both <Sequence> nodes portray the same message, but are just worded differently.
          
          The probability is the likelihood of an item being chosen over other probable items, based on the cumulative probability.
          Example: If 3 <Sequence> nodes all have a probability of "10", then each <Sequence> node has a 33% chance of being selected.
                   If one <Sequence> node has a probability of 20, now it has double the chance of being chosed over a <Sequence>
                   element with a probability of 10.

            In this initial Sequence (if selected at random based on the "probability"), we have 3 callbacks we can hook into
            within the CalloutScenario using the following method: Dialogue.RegisterCallback(name, Action);
            
            For all intents and purposes, a callback is basically just an event created dynamically, and calls on the Action
            supplied when the callback is registered in the CalloutScenario. Callbacks are not required to be defined.
            
            The "onFirstShown" callback gets fired when the first <Subtitle> node is displayed in game, calling the action
            registered as "First_Shown" ( Dialogue.RegisterCallback("First_Shown", Action) ) 
            
            The "onLastShown" callback gets fired when the last <Subtitle> node is displayed in game, calling the action
            registered as "Last_Shown" ( Dialogue.RegisterCallback("Last_Shown", Action) ) 
            
            The "elapsed" callback gets fired when the last <Subtitle> node has finished displaying in game, calling the action
            registered as "Elapsed_Shown" ( Dialogue.RegisterCallback("Elapsed_Shown", Action) )  
            
            A good use of callbacks would be to initiate a gun fight with the player after a subtitle is displayed, or run away
            from the officer, or making the ped preform a scenario. Really the posibilities are endless here.
