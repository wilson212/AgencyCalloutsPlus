ToDO:
	- Finish the virtual simulation system for agencies
	- Finish the CAD
	- Finish adding "Add x location" for each location types in the plugin menu
	- Code scenarios for callouts
	- Plan on the implementation of AmbientEvents as well as AiOfficerEvents
	- Finish implementing an interface for UltimateBackup to use
		- OR implement out own backup system
	- Convert TimePeriod to 6 periods instead of 4.


 Planned Location types:
	- RoadShoulder: Used for pullovers, and simple accidents
	- Road: Used for more serious accidents where Peds wont pull off the road. Used to spawn moving vehicles for crimes
	- Intersection: Used for crimes that happen in an intersection
	- Residence: Used for crimes that happen at a residence
	- Business: Used for robberies or public altercations
	- ParkingLot: Used for some crimes
	- SecludedSpot: Used for crimes that require privacy, such as public indecency or prostitution


Event planning:
	- Difference between an Events and Callouts:
		Callout:
			- Requires the player to accept it before any entities are spawned into the world
			- Ends when the player ignores it, and gets cleaned up immediatly
		AmbientEvent:
			- Spawns entities near the player, and a crime is commited. The player can choose to ignore
				or participate in the event without requiring a "Press {insertbuttonhere} to accept"
			- An event keeps playing until a player moves out of range
		AiOfficerEvent:
			- These are virtual events that happen in memory, but lead to a Callout

	- 3 Difference Callout Sources:
		- Incoming 911 call from civilian (Callout)
		- AI officer scripted event turned into a CalloutScenario (AiOfficerEvent) (Think "shots fired at officers" during a traffic stop)
		- Ambient event ignored by player, turns into a CalloutScenario (AmbientEvent) sometimes
