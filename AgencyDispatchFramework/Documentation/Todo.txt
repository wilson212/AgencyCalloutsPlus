Event planning:
	- Difference between an Events and Callouts:
		Callout:
			- Requires the player to accept it before any entities are spawned into the world
			- Ends when the player ignores it, and gets cleaned up immediatly
		AmbientEvent:
			- Spawns entities near the player, and a crime is commited. The player can choose to ignore
				or participate in the event without requiring a "Press {insertbuttonhere} to accept"
			- An event keeps playing until a player moves out of range
		AiOfficerEvent:
			- These are virtual events that happen in memory, but lead to a Callout

	- 3 Difference Callout Sources:
		- Incoming 911 call from civilian (Callout)
		- AI officer scripted event turned into a CalloutScenario (AiOfficerEvent) (Think "shots fired at officers" during a traffic stop)
		- Ambient event ignored by player, turns into a CalloutScenario (AmbientEvent) sometimes
